# PraxiLabs_Task

A school needs a game to teach primitive 3D objects and how they interact with lights and colors. Use
Unity3d primitive shapes (Cube-Cylinder-sphere) as options for the player to change between in
runtime, along with limited color options(red-green-blue), and make sure the player can rotate the
shape by holding and dragging the right mouse button, use stable directional light(no need to change
default light).

• Your designed UI won’t be assessed however it should be responsive to window changes.

• Make sure the project is well-structured and well-documented, using a Factory design pattern is
mandatory

• Make the player able to save and load shapes with color and rotation using XML.
